GX IEC Developer 7.04 is based on the IEC 1131.3 standard, which is an international standard for PLC programming languages. The advantages of using this standard are:

- It allows you to use different programming languages according to your preference and application needs.
- It enables you to reuse and share programs and libraries across different PLC models and brands.
- It ensures compatibility and interoperability with other devices and systems that follow the same standard.
- It facilitates communication and documentation with other programmers and engineers who use the same standard.

GX IEC Developer 7.04 is designed to work with MELSEC PLCs, which are manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. However, it may also be possible to use it with other PLC brands that support the IEC 1131.3 standard, such as Siemens, Schneider, Omron and Allen-Bradley. To do so, you need to check the compatibility and specifications of each PLC model and adjust the settings and parameters accordingly. You may also need to use additional software or hardware tools to communicate and transfer programs between different PLCs.
